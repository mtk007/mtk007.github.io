                <p>
                    Before you have to ask - yes, I AM a running junkie. I have participated in the state meet as an athlete and coach, received a partial athletic scholarship in college, know what it feels like to make it as alternate runner and a coach to a national meet, and actually won $100 one summer for being the first to the finish at the Rockport, IN 5k. Currently, I am well past a decade into officiating at collegiate meets. If I had to guess, I have worked over 100 meets now. It keeps me connected to the sport I love and is a way to give back. Occasionally the sport gains me opportunity to meet Olympic-level runners, including a memorable conversation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mills" target="_blank" alt="Billy Mills">Billy Mills</a>. I also guide athlete-clients who find me via <a href="https://www.coachup.com/coaches/mattk" alt=coachup.com target="_blank">CoachUp.com</a>. I live purposely by the biggest park I could find in Indy to, you guessed it, go on trail runs whenever the whim strikes. 
                    Outside of my obvious passion for various means of visual communication, my other outlet of sport has served me well over the years and taught me many lessons. If you ever catch me burning a vacation friday to drive several hours to work a two-day track meet somewhere - know it is a GOOD thing.  In addition, I like good food, good music and other good things.
